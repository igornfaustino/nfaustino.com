description: What are the benefits to share your learning process with other people and why I think you should try
---

Today I want to talk about something that has been on my mind for a couple of weeks. That is the concept of learning in public.

I recently joined a study group, and one of the topics discussed was learning in public. Learning in public means sharing the things you are working on with other people. It doesn't matter if it is a personal project, a hobby, or some random fact that you discover. Sharing learning with others helps you organize your thoughts and allow you to learn from other people as well.

As I keep going to the study group, I understand that sharing my learning with other people helps me to learn fast and helps me avoid silly mistakes since everybody could share their experience over the topic that I was researching.

Overall, I don't think you should join a study group to start learning in public. Presently we have tons of ways to share our learnings. It could be as simple as a social media post telling what you are learning at the moment, or you could go further and create a blog or a youtube channel.

I'm a shy person. I hate posting things on social media, so I know that sharing your learning can be difficult, but I think it is worth it (I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't). Overall I think everyone should at least try.

People like me, who want to try but are afraid of being judged by other people, have to understand that it's okay to make mistakes. But learning in public gives you a chance to learn from that mistakes.

Even though nobody ever reads your post, you still will be having the experience of learning in public. You will organize your thoughts, and you will be producing some material that you can consult in the future, allowing you to learn from your past self.
The main goal is not to reach out to tons of people but to help yourself in the learning process.

In the end, if I can give you one piece of advice about learning in public. Write down the material you wish you would have found as you begin to study the subject. I'm sure that your view of the topic can be helpful to someone else just like you and, most importantly, can be very useful for you
